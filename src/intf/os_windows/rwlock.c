// RW Lock
//

// we keep the API for symmetry.
//
// write_locked tracks whether the current holder acquired it
// exclusively, since ReleaseSRWLock* has two separate callsites.
// This is only safe because smartfile's rwlock contract requires
// a single writer OR multiple readers — not concurrent mixed use
// on the same i_rwlock instance from different threads calling
// unlock simultaneously.
