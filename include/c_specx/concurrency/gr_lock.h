/**
 * lock waiters are allocated on the stack - so a waiter only exists
 * for as long as gr_lock is waiting. Therefore, there is no array of
 * granted lock groups, instead, I use a counter to count how many locks
 * of each type are granted.
 *
 * This comes with drawbacks.
 *
 * 1. There is no priority - The only priority that's ensured is that the order
 *    of the condition variable signals is the same as the order that they came in,
 *    which is ok, but not the best.
 *
 * In order to add priority I need to keep track of the list of granted locks - which
 * would mean some sort of allocation or intrusive data structure.
 *
 * One idea would be to have a gr_lock live on the stack and it's lifecycle is tied
 * to one lock unlock flow, which is probably what I'll do, but for now, locks have
 * loose priority until it becomes a performance problem
