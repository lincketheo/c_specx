/*
 * A polymorphic byte-oriented I/O interface used throughout NumStore.
 *
 * A stream wraps a (pull, push, close) vtable
 * The `done` flag signals end-of-data; a stream sets it via
 * stream_finish() when it has no more bytes to produce or accept.  Callers
 * test it with stream_isdone() to decide when to stop reading or writing.
 *
 *   stream_bread(dest, size, n, src)  — pull up to n elements of [size] bytes
 *                                       from src into the dest buffer.
 *   stream_bwrite(buf, size, n, dest) — push n elements of [size] bytes from
 *                                       buf into dest.
 *   stream_read(dest, size, n, src)   — stream-to-stream copy.
 *
 * All three return the number of elements transferred (>= 0) or a negative
 * error code.  A return value smaller than n does not indicate an error;
 * the caller should check stream_isdone() to distinguish short-read from
 * error.
 *
 * Concrete stream implementations included here:
 *   stream_ibuf    — pulls from a fixed const byte buffer (read source).
 *   stream_obuf    — pushes into a fixed mutable byte buffer (write sink).
 *   stream_sink    — discards all bytes written to it (null sink).
 *   stream_opsink  — applies a callback to each element pushed.
 *   stream_limit   — wraps another stream and enforces a byte limit.
